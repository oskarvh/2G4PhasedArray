--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P1" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P1" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P3" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P3" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.
